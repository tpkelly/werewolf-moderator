==================

A moderator aide for playing Werewolf by Bristol/Brighton group rules

# Rule Clarifications

Some rules and situations have been hard-coded into the app, which have resulted from moderator discussion during previous games, or from trying to interpret the letter of the rules. Examples of these which the app handles are as follows;

- Minion Juliet will not be destined to die if Romeo burns at the stake.
- The Guardian Angel will take the place of the Guarded in the first round of voting if possible, as well as the second.
- The Guardian Angel cannot save the Guarded from the Ballot if the Angel is already on the ballot.
- Igor only dies in the Vampire's place during the Vampire attack phase, not during the Ballot or the Wolf attack phase.
- The second round ballot will feature players who were given the highest and second highest number of votes in the first round, even in the event of tying for highest.
  - E.g. Votes = A:5, B:5, C:3, D:3, E:1. Ballot = [A, B, C, D] even though A and B were tied.
- If the second round ballot is a tie, nobody dies.
- Farmer as no powers. We don't play the Hero/Regular/Wolf Farmer types.
- The village receives news so long as the reelvant news role (bard/innkeeper) are alive and the clairvoyant was alive to check. News still comes out if the clairvoyant checked for corruption then died before dawn.
- Healers cannot save anybody if they are destined to die, even if they are not trying to save themselves.

As with most things I write, these are tested explicitly so should always hold true in any release! (Hopefully).
